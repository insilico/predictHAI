Predict day28 flu HAI with reGAIN feature selection from baseline gene expression

Authors: Saeid Parvandeh and Brett McKinney

### How to find vignettes
There are two vignettes, PredictHAI_Titers.Rmd and PredictHAI_BaselineGeneExpression.Rmd. The first one shows the steps of HAI modeling where we only use antibody titers data, and the second shows the prediction of day28 HAI using reGAIN features selection with the use of nested-CV on baseline gene expression. 


# How to find Shiny app
We developed a flexible and user-friendly tool as a Shiny application based on available packages and functions in R statistical language that is hosted by web server and can be found at http://insilico.utulsa.edu/predictHAI/
